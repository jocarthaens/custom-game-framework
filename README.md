A work-in-progress project that attempts to create a simple, custom game framework for my 2D topdown games from scratch, with the goal of making the program as memory-efficient as possible while making it modular. Prone to heavy editing changes (some features will be removed or revamped).

Features:
+Sprite rendering system, sprite classes, image/sprite storage
+text formatting
+collision system, 
+gui system
+maths, geometry, vectors and transforms
+spatial navigation classes, 
+keyboard and mouse input, 
+audio
+entity system

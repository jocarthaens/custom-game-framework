A work-in-progress personal project that attempts to create a simple, custom game framework for my 2D topdown games from scratch, with the goal of making the program as memory-efficient as possible while ensuring modularity and flexibility in creating games with it. This project is prone to heavy changes, some features will be drastically revamped or removed, and this project is made only for single-threaded applications.

## Features:
+ Sprite rendering system, sprite and text format classes, image/sprite storage
+ Collision System
+ GUI System
+ Maths, Geometry, Vectors and Transforms
+ Spatial/Navigation classes (AStar and Spatial Hash Grid)
+ Keyboard and Mouse Input
+ Audio
+ Entity System

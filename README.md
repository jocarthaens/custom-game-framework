A work-in-progress project that attempts to create a simple, custom game framework for my 2D topdown games from scratch, with the goal of making the program as memory-efficient as possible while making it modular. Features a sprite rendering system, sprite classes, text formatting, and a library for storing graphics-related class objects, a collision system, gui system, maths and vectors, spatial navigation classes, keyboard and mosue input, audio, and an entity system.

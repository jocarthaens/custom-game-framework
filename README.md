A work-in-progress personal project that aims to create a simple, custom game framework for my 2D topdown games from scratch, with the goal of making the framework as performant and memory-efficient as possible, while ensuring modularity and flexibility in creating games with it. This project is prone to heavy changes, some features will be drastically revamped or removed, and this project is intended only for single-threaded applications.

## Features:
+ Sprite Rendering System, Sprite and TextFormat classes, Image/Sprite Library
+ Collision System
+ GUI System
+ Maths, Geometry, Shapes, Vectors and Transforms
+ Spatial/Navigation classes (AStar, Spatial Hash Grid)
+ Keyboard and Mouse Input
+ Audio System
+ Signals/Events System (Emitter and Receiver)
+ Entity-Component-System Architecture (Serves as GameObjects, may be removed or changed)
+ Some utility/helper classes (Copyable, Object Pool, BitVectors, etc.)

## To Add:
+ Save/Load System
+ Tile System
+ Scene System (Manages Game Objects, Tiles, and GUIs)
